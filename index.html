  <h1>Hi, I'm <span>DUSHYANTH REDDY PISATI</span></h1>
  <h3>📊 Data Analyst · BI & Dashboard Specialist · SQL & Python Expert</h3>
  
  <p>
    I am a passionate Data Analyst with expertise in transforming complex, raw, and unstructured datasets into actionable insights 📊 that drive business strategy and operational excellence.  
    Skilled in Python 🐍, SQL 🗄️, Excel 📈, Tableau 📊, Power BI 📉, and advanced ETL pipelines, I build scalable data solutions that streamline analytics workflows and improve decision-making accuracy 💡.  
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience includes designing end-to-end ETL pipelines to extract, clean, and structure data from multiple sources, ensuring reliable, high-quality datasets for analysis.  
    I perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and predictive modeling to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and provide actionable insights.  
    From millions of transaction records to organizational employee data, I turn raw data into clear, insightful, and reproducible reports that inform key business decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in creating interactive dashboards and KPI reports that allow stakeholders to monitor performance, track metrics in real-time, and make evidence-based strategic decisions.  
    My work bridges the gap between data and business impact, whether it’s analyzing workforce diversity, optimizing inventory and sales, or monitoring environmental and urban datasets for risk and compliance.  
    By combining data engineering, analytics, and visualization skills, I deliver insights that drive efficiency, growth, and innovation 🚀.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, I leverage cloud platforms like AWS ☁️ and Azure to build scalable analytics pipelines and automate workflows, reducing manual effort and improving reporting speed.  
    My goal is to empower organizations with actionable intelligence by transforming raw data into dashboards, predictive models, and reports that help teams make smarter, faster, and more data-driven decisions.
